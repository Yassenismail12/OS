1. Initialize an empty queue to hold the processes.

2. For each process in the list of processes:
     a. Add the process to the queue.

3. Set the current_time variable to 0.

4. While the queue is not empty:
     a. Dequeue the next process from the front of the queue.
     b. Set the start_time of the process to max(current_time, arrival_time).
     c. Update the current_time to the sum of start_time and burst_time.
     d. Set the completion_time and turnaround_time of the process.
     e. Calculate the waiting_time of the process as turnaround_time - burst_time.

5. Calculate the average waiting_time, turnaround_time, and completion_time.

6. Print the scheduling results.
