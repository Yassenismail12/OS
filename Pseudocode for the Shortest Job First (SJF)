1. Sort the list of processes based on their burst time in ascending order.
2. Set the current_time variable to 0.
3. Initialize an empty list called completed_processes.
4. While there are still processes in the list:
     a. Find the process with the shortest burst time that has arrived (burst time > 0).
     b. Add the process to the completed_processes list.
     c. Update the current_time by adding the burst time of the completed process.
     d. Decrease the burst time of all other processes in the list by the burst time of the completed process.
5. Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process in the completed_processes list.
6. Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time for all processes.
