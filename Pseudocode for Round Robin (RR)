1. Create a queue to hold the processes.
2. Initialize a time quantum (time_slice).
3. While the queue is not empty:
     a. Dequeue the next process from the front of the queue.
     b. Execute the process for the time quantum (time_slice).
     c. If the process completes, print its completion time and remove it from the queue.
     d. If the process does not complete within the time quantum:
          - Print the time quantum expired for the process.
          - Enqueue the process back to the end of the queue.
