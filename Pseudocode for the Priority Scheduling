1. Create a list of processes with their arrival time, burst time, and priority.
2. Sort the list of processes based on their priority (higher priority value indicates higher priority).
3. Set the current_time variable to 0.
4. Create an empty ready_queue and completed_processes list.
5. While there are processes in the list or ready_queue is not empty:
     a. Remove processes from the list whose arrival time is less than or equal to the current_time and add them to the ready_queue.
     b. If the ready_queue is empty, increment the current_time by 1 and continue to the next iteration.
     c. Sort the ready_queue based on priority (higher priority first).
     d. Get the process with the highest priority from the ready_queue.
     e. Execute the process for its burst time.
     f. Decrement the burst time of the executed process by the time it was executed.
     g. If the process still has burst time remaining, add it back to the ready_queue.
     h. If the process has completed (burst time becomes 0), add it to the completed_processes list.
     i. Increment the current_time by the burst time of the executed process.
6. Calculate waiting time for each completed process using the formula: waiting time = completion time - burst time - arrival time.
7. Calculate average waiting time by summing up the waiting times of all completed processes and dividing by the total number of processes.
8. Display the completed_processes list and average waiting time.
