1. Create multiple queues, each representing a different priority level.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the processes.
3. Repeat the following steps until all processes are executed:
     a. Check if any new process has arrived. If yes, assign it to the appropriate queue based on its priority.
     b. If the highest priority queue is not empty, execute the process at the front of that queue.
     c. If the process completes its execution, remove it from the queue.
     d. If the process does not complete within its time quantum, move it to the next lower priority queue.
     e. If all queues are empty, go to step a.
